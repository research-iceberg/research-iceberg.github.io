# How to contribute

There are two ways to submit a paper to the Journal of the Atmospheric Mistakes:
1. Write a text file and send it to the editor via [email](mailto:code@martinjucker.com). The editor will review the text and publish it if accepted.
2. The GitHub way:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Create a new branch
  3. Write your paper in a new file
  4. Create a pull request into the master branch
  5. Wait for acceptance by the editor

In all cases, a new "release" will be created at publication, and a citable DOI will automatically be generated.
