# How to contribute

There are two ways to submit a contribution to Iceberg:
1. (preferred) The GitHub way:
 - Make sure you have a GitHub account (free and useful)
 - Clone the Iceberg repository at https://github.com/research-iceberg/research-iceberg.github.io
 - Create a new branch, preferably with the author name
 - Create a new directory `papers/AUTHOR_NAME_YYYYMM`, where `YYYY` is year and `MM` month
 - Copy the file `papers/template.tex.md` to `papers/AUTHOR_NAME_YYYYMM/new_file_name.tex.md`
 - Important: DO NOT COPY `papers/template.md`! COPY `papers/template.tex.md` INSTEAD!
 - TeXify will convert all `.tex.md` files into `.md` files by rendering LaTeX code within $.$ signs
 - Write your paper in this new markdown file
 - Create a pull request into the master branch
 - A referee will be assigned to the pull request
 - Responds to the referee comments
 - Wait for acceptance by the editor

In case of any problems and/or need of help concerning GitHub workflows, do not hesitate to
[contact the editor](mailto:research.iceberg@gmail.com). This is the preferred way and
the editor will be happy to help!
2. Write a text file and send it to the editor via [email](mailto:research.iceberg@gmail.com). The editor will review the text, add it to the GitHub repository and publish it when accepted.

In all cases, every published paper will receive
- a mention of the reviewer
- a citable DOI via [Zenodo](www.zenodo.org).
- a rendered PDF, to which the DOI is attributed to.
- a _Comments_ section at the end of the paper, which will be open to comments from any GitHub user.
