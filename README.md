# Journal of Unpublished Research

The **Journal of Unpublished Research** was created after hearing one of many inspiring lectures by Isaac Held at the [22nd Conference on Atmospheric and Oceanic Fluid Dynamics](https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/meetings-events/ams-meetings/22nd-conference-on-atmospheric-and-oceanic-fluid-dynamics/) in Portland, Maine 2019.
The lecture was a about the history of geophysical fluid dynamics. The introductory words
mentioned that we need to know history to avoid repeating mistakes.
But during the lectures, only the greatest minds and their biggest breakthroughs were highlighted, and it struck me that we don't publish our mistakes in academia, and therefore we currently
**have no system to make others aware of our mistakes, dead ends and trials so that they don't repeat them**.

Therefore, _JUR [d&#658;&#601;r]_ has been founded so that the brave and the bold can let others know what mistakes they made or generally which things they tried that didn't work, so that others shall be warned.

The journal aims to be open to all science and it calls for papers which describe
- research and/or coding errors and dead ends which have a high potential of being repeated by many more people in the field.
- the environment, causes and (if possible) solutions.

Please read the [contributions page](CONTRIBUTE.MD) to learn how to submit your paper.

Looking forward to many contributions,
