# How to contribute

There are two ways to submit a paper to the Journal of Unpublished Research:
1. Write a text file and send it to the editor via [email](mailto:code@martinjucker.com). The editor will review the text and publish it if accepted.
2. The GitHub way:
 - Clone the JUR repository at https://github.com/unpublished-publishing/JUR
 - Create a new branch
 - Write your paper in a new markdown file
 - Create a pull request into the master branch
 - Wait for acceptance by the editor

In all cases, a new "release" will be created at publication, and a citable DOI will automatically be generated.
