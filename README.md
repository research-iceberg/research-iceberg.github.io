# Journal of Unpublished Research

The **Journal of Unpublished Research** was created after hearing one of many inspiring lectures by Isaac Held.
The lecture was a about the history of geophyiscal fluid dynamics. The introductory words
mentioned that we need to know history to avoid repeating mistakes.
But during the lectures, only the greatest minds and their biggest breakthroughs were highlighted, it struck me that we don't publish our mistakes in academia, and therefore we currently
**have no system to make others aware of our mistakes so that they don't repeat them**.

Therefore, I have founded _JUR [char]_, so that the brave and the bold can let others know what mistakes they made or generally which things they tried that didn't work, so that others shall be warned.

Papers are called which describe
- research and/or coding errors which have a high potential of being repeated by many more people in the field.
- the environment, causes and (if possible) solutions to the mistakes.

Please read the [contributions page](CONTRIBUTE.MD) to learn how to submit your paper.
