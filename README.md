**Iceberg** is a collection of scientific works which do not fit into any traditional journal
or software repository. It aims at making available the things which are good to know for fellow
researchers. Examples are experience with trial-and-error approaches which eventually did or did not
make it to a journal publications. Or general scientific expertise, such as how to best set up an experiment
(numerical or not) to avoid common pitfalls which others are likely to encounter. Or a blog-style post on
best practices and/or software recommendations.

In short, we want to reveal the bulk of the iceberg, where the tip represents traditional journal publications.

It came about by thinking about the importance of learning from our mistakes, which is in direct conflict with the
all too present pressure to only show success and what worked, while everything we tried and didn't work does not
get published. We want to enable learning from mistakes in academia. "Mistakes" here is a very broad term for trial-and-error, how to choose reasonable parameters for a given experiment, how to compute derived variables, etc.

Because without this, we have no system to make others aware of our mistakes, dead ends and trials to make sure they
don't repeat them.

Iceberg functions like a scientific journal in that it consists of written contributions which are peer-reviewed and obtain a permanent DOI. It aims to be open to all science and it calls for papers which describe
- research and/or coding errors and dead ends which have a high potential of being repeated by many more people in the field.
- the environment, causes and (if possible) solutions.

Please read the [contributions page](CONTRIBUTE.MD) to learn how to submit your contribution.

There is also a [post about the philosophy and creation of Iceberg online](https://climateextremes.org.au/learning-from-your-their-mistakes/).

Looking forward to much uncovered science,
