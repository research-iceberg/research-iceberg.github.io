The **Journal of the Atmospheric Mistakes (JAM)** was created after hearing one of many inspiring lectures by Isaac Held. 
The lecture was a about the history of geophyiscal fluid dynamics. The introductory words
mentioned that we need to know history to avoid repeating mistakes. 
But during the lectures, only the greatest minds and their biggest breakthroughs were highlighted, it struck me that we don't publish our mistakes in academia, and therefore we currently
**have no system to make others aware of our mistakes so that they don't repeat them**. 

Therefore, I have founded _JAM_, so that the brave and the bold can let others know what mistakes they made, so that others shall be warned.
