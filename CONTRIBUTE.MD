# How to contribute

There are two ways to submit a paper to the Journal of Unpublished Research:
1. (preferred) The GitHub way:
 - Make sure you have a GitHub account (free and useful)
 - Clone the JUR repository at https://github.com/unpublished-publishing/JUR
 - Create a new branch, preferably with the author name
 - Copy the file `papers/template.tex.md` to `papers/new_file_name.tex.md`
 - Important: DO NOT COPY `papers/template.md`! COPY `papers/template.tex.md` INSTEAD!
 - TeXify will convert all `.tex.md` files into `.md` files by rendering LaTeX code within $.$ signs
 - Write your paper in this new markdown file
 - Create a pull request into the master branch
 - Wait for acceptance by the editor

In case of any problems and/or need of help concerning GitHub workflows, do not hesitate to
[contact the editor](mailto:unpublished.publishing@gmail.com). This is the preferred way and
the editor will be happy to help!
2. Write a text file and send it to the editor via [email](mailto:unpublished.publishing@gmail.com). The editor will review the text, add it to the GitHub repository and publish it when accepted.

In all cases, every published paper will receive
- a citable DOI via [Zenodo](www.zenodo.org).
- a rendered PDF, to which the DOI is attributed to.
- a _Comments_ section at the end of the paper, which will be open to comments from any GitHub user.
